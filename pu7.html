    <h1>Kapurthala</h1>
    <p>One of the less-known places to visit in Punjab, Kapurthala is known as the Paris of Punjab, owing to its intriguing architectural scenario. Most landmarks here are built in French and Indo-Saracen styles of architecture. There also are interesting legends you can know about during your trip to the city. For someone who wishes to explore a city with lovely architecture, Kapurthala is nothing less than a treasure among Punjab sightseeing gems! This is one of the best places to visit in Punjab in June.
