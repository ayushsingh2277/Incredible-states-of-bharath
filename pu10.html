    <h1>Anandpur Sahib</h1>
    <p>Anandpur Sahib, known as the “Holy City of Bliss,” is a sacred town in the Indian state of Punjab. It is one of the most important pilgrimage sites for Sikhs, as it was founded by Guru Tegh Bahadur and is where the Khalsa Panth, the Sikh brotherhood, was formally established by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699. Set against the scenic backdrop of the Shivalik Hills, Anandpur Sahib combines spiritual significance with natural beauty, making it a serene and enriching destination.</p>
