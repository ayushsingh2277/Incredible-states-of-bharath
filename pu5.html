    <h1>Sirhind</h1>
    <p>Sirhind was earlier known as Fatehgarh Sahib. It was a military outpost of Prithviraj Chauhan in his revolt against Muhammad Ghori. The place turned out to be part of Ghauri Sultanate and later in the year 1362, it was refounded by Tughlaq emperors. If you visit Sirhind, you will witness the traces of its past story giving you a perfect chance of exploring the struggles of previous kings.<br>

        Currently, it is a prominent pilgrimage spot for Sikhs as the two young sons of Guru Gobind Singh were brutally killed here. This is amongst the best tourist places in Punjab to explore the culture and serenity of the region.
